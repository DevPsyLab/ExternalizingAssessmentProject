The `.md` and `.html` files are generated from the `.Rmd` file.
Make sure to make any edits to the `.Rmd` file (not the `.md` and `.html` files).

# R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document.
Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents.
For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document.

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor.
Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks.
Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

# Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# Headings

## Subheading

### Subsubheading

#### Subsubsubheading

# Lists

To add another element in a list while preserving the continuity of the list, indent the element four spaces or one tab.

## Unordered Lists

To create an unordered list, add dashes (-), asterisks (*), or plus signs (+) in front of line items.

- one item
- one item
- one item
    - one more item
    - one more item
    - one more item
        - lower level
            - sub-item 1
            - sub-item 2

## Ordered Lists

1. the first item
    1. test
    1. test
        1. new test
        1. new test
1. the second item
    1. test
    1. test
1. the third item
    - one unordered item
        - subitem
    - one unordered item
1. fourth item
    1. test
    1. test
    1. test

# Code/Syntax Highlighting

To use syntax highlighting to display code without running the code:

```r
summary(cars)
```

or

```{r, eval = FALSE}
summary(cars)
```

or

    summary(cars)

# Math Formulas

Inline:

This is the formula: $x = y + 5$. Solve for $x$.

Separate line:

$$
y = \frac{x}{7} \cdot 4 + 3 \times 2 - 1_{a1}/2^{1c/2} \dots
$$

# Links

[I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com)

[I'm an inline-style link with title](https://www.google.com "Google's Homepage")

[I'm a reference-style link][Arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]

[I'm a relative reference to a repository file](../blob/master/LICENSE)

[You can use numbers for reference-style link definitions][1]

URLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links. 
http://www.example.com or <http://www.example.com>

Some text to show that the reference links can follow later.

# Footnotes

Here is a simple footnote[^1].

A footnote can also have multiple lines[^2].  

You can also use words, to fit your writing style more closely[^note].

[^1]: My reference.
[^2]: Every new line should be prefixed with 2 spaces.  
  This allows you to have a footnote with multiple lines.
[^note]:
    Named footnotes will still render with numbers instead of the text but allow easier identification and linking.  
    This footnote also has been made with a different syntax using 4 spaces for new lines.
